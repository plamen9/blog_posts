# Text Field with Autocomplete

> The `Autocomplete` item has been reimagined as a native APEX web-component and provides a more streamlined user experience, support for icons, cascading list of values, and more.

Allowing developers to have more control over this item makes it a good option to use instead of `Popup LOV` or the `Select List` items. It is something in-between these two and the `Text Field` item. Depending on the use case, especially when there is a big number of results that should be available to select from, the `Text Field with Autocomplete` item, with '**Lazy Loading**' turned on can decrease the loading time and only display as many results as needed and only when needed. The item itself is simpler that the Popup LOV and doesn't display additional popup which I personally prefer.
