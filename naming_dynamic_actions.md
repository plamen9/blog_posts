# Naming Dynamic Actions 

> You can now specify a custom name for your True or False actions, enabling you to remove the guesswork from selecting the right action within Page Designer.

Built upon request from the APEX community, this feature is really helpful when you have a big number of Dynamic Actions, each having a big number of True/False Actions. Prior to that version, you had to go through each of them to see what they actually do in case you wanted some logic being changed. It happen a lot faster now just naming them and going through the list. And to illustrate that, here is an example of a Dynamic Action with multiple True actions in 22.1 and 22.2:

In addition, each Action is now having its own icon, which makes it even easier to visually recognise the Action Type. Good job, APEX team!
